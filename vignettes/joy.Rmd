```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE, 
  warning = FALSE,
  message = FALSE, 
  comment = "#>",
  dev.args = list(bg = "transparent")
)

#knitr::knit_hooks$set(output = multimedia::ansi_aware_handler)

```

```{r setup}
library(multimedia)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggraph)

exper <- mediation_data(demo_joy(), "PHQ", "treatment", starts_with("ASV"))
```

### Specification

```{r}
model <- multimedia(exper) |>
  estimate(exper)

model
```

```{r}
ggraph(model@edges) +
  geom_edge_link(arrow = arrow()) +
  geom_node_label(aes(label = name, fill = node_type))
```

### Estimation

```{r}
model <- estimate(model, exper)
model@outcome@estimates
model@mediation@estimates
```

Sample the full model at original treatment.

```{r}
sample(model)
predict(model)
```

Sample at new mediator and outcome treatments. This assumes the same treatment
applies to all mediators and outcomes.

```{r}
t1 <- tibble(treatment = rep("Treatment", 3))
t2 <- tibble(treatment = rep("Control", 3))
profile <- setup_profile(model, t1, t2)
sample(model, profile)
```

Here is a generalization that allows different treatments for individual
mediators and outcomes.

```{r}
profile <- setup_profile(model, t1, t2)
profile@t_mediator[["ASV1"]]$treatment <- "Control"
sample(model, profile = profile)
predict(model, profile = profile)
```

We can also contrast different samples.

```{r}
contrast_predictions(model, profile, profile)
contrast_samples(model, profile, profile)
```


### Effects

This covers the case of one treatment with two levels. Will need to test a few
more general cases:

* One treatment, many categorical levels.
* Multiple treatments, many categorical levels.
* One treatment, continuous.
* Multiple treatments, continuous.

```{r}
direct_effect(model)
indirect_overall(model)
indirect_pathwise(model)
```

```{r}
model <- multimedia(
    exper, 
    outcome_estimator = glmnet_model(lambda = seq(0.1, 1, 0.01))
  ) |>
  estimate(exper)

direct_effect(model)
indirect_overall(model)
indirect_pathwise(model)
```
