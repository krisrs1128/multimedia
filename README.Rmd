`multimedia` is an R package for **multi**domain **media**tion analysis of
microbiome data. It makes it easy to curate data, specify mediation and outcome
model formulas, and carry out inference for direct and indirect effects. By
specifying causal relationships between different data domains, it can support
principled data integration. You can read more about the package in our
preprint:

[H. Jiang, X. Miao, M. W. Thairu, M. Beebe, D. W. Grupe, R. J. Davidson, J. Handelsman, and K. Sankaran (2024). multimedia: Multimodal Mediation Analysis of Microbiome Data.]()

The preprint describes the scientific context and interpretation for two of the
vignettes in this package. One gives a multi-omics analysis of IBD, and the
other describes how to model compositional outcomes in a study of depression.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/krisrs1128/multimedia) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("krisrs1128/multimedia")
```

## Example

Here is a simple example of estimating direct and indirect effects using the
package. The data are randomly generated (no real effects), but we will proceed
as if the ASV columns mediate the relationship between `treatment` and `PHQ`.
This is supposed to mimic the possibility that the microbiome (ASV = Amplicon
Sequence Variant) might mediate the relationship between a treatment and
depression (PHQ = Patient Health Questionnaire). You can find more details in
the `random.Rmd` vignette.

The original data here are a `SummarizedExperiment`. The package can also take
phyloseq objects and plain data.frames.

```{r}
library(multimedia)
demo_joy()
```

Next, we specify which columns are the treatment, mediators, and outcomes.

```{r}
exper <- mediation_data(demo_joy(), "PHQ", "treatment", starts_with("ASV"))
exper
```

From here, we can estimate the model and calculate effects. By default, the
package uses a linear model.

```{r}
model <- multimedia(exper) |>
  estimate(exper)
model
```

We can calculate different types of effects using the estimated model. Since
we're using a linear model, the effects are identical for the two indirect
settings. We could also visualize and carry out inference on these effects --
see the vignettes for more examples.

```{r}
direct_effect(model, exper)
indirect_overall(model, exper)
```

If we want to use a different type of model, we can just modify the original
`multimedia` specification. Below we use a sparse regression model, which
correctly recovers that the direct effects are 0.

```{r}
multimedia(exper, glmnet_model(lambda = .1)) |>
  estimate(exper) |>
  direct_effect()
```
